### BME2111 Neural Signal Processing and Data Analysis (ShanghaiTech)
Graduate course, Instructor, *Offered in Fall 2022, Fall 2023, Fall 2024*

A graduate course in the field of intelligent medicine within biomedical engineering. As an introductory course to computational neuroscience and neural engineering, it is suitable for graduate students and senior undergraduates who aspire to pursue research in neural engineering, computational neuroscience, and related fields. The course mainly introduces the application of modern statistical signal processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence technologies in neuroscience. It specifically focuses on how to record and describe neural signals, how to establish statistical models for different scales of experimental data, how to use statistical and machine learning methods to analyze neural data, and then analyze the characteristics of neural systems. It also integrates signal processing and control technologies to decode and regulate neural systems, cognitive behaviors, and psychiatric diseases. Through this course, students will understand and master the theories and methods of data analysis commonly used in neuroscience, laying the foundation for research in brain science, neural engineering, computational neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and related fields.


### BME1106 Biomedical Signals and Systems II: Digital Signal Processing (ShanghaiTech)
Undergraduate course, Instructor, *Offered in Spring 2023, Spring 2024, Spring 2025*

This is a foundational course in BME, which covers the digital representation of signals and the use of digital computers or digital circuits to analyze, modify, and extract information from signals. In biomedical engineering, electronic and computer engineering courses, digital signal processing is widely emphasized as a fundamental skill. The course aims to equip students with basic knowledge of digital signal processing, including time and frequency domain analysis methods for discrete-time signals and systems, mathematical models and concepts for signal sampling and reconstruction, basic concepts of discrete Fourier transform and signal spectral analysis methods, fundamental principles of the fast Fourier transform algorithm, and basic methods for designing digital filters.
