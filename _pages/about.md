## Yuanning Li, Ph.D. [[CV]](/files/Yuanning_Li_CV.pdf)

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [School of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.shanghaitech.edu.cn/bme_en/) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), where I direct the Computational Cognitive and Translational Neuroscience Lab. I am also a visiting investigator at the Neurosurgical Institute of Fudan University, Huashan Hospital. My lab mainly uses human electrophysiology and computational methods to study the neural basis of high-level cognitive processes, including speech, language and vision. 

Before joining ShanghaiTech, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the [Department of Neurological Surgery](http://neurosurgery.ucsf.edu/) at the [University of California, San Francisco](https://www.ucsf.edu/), where I worked with [Edward Chang](http://changlab.ucsf.edu). Prior to UCSF, I completed my PhD in the joint Program in [Neural Computation](http://compneuro.cmu.edu) & [Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) and the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu), where I was co-advised by [Avniel Ghuman](http://lcnd.pitt.edu) (with [Pitt Neurological Surgery](http://www.neurosurgery.pitt.edu)) and [Max G'Sell](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mgsell/) (with [CMU Statistics](http://www.stat.cmu.edu)). Before my PhD, I received Master's degree in [Electrical & Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.cmu.edu) from Carnegie Mellon and Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [School of Advanced Engineering](http://sae.buaa.edu.cn) at [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/). 

My research interests primarily lie in the intersection between computational and cognitive neuroscience. The two main goals of my research are: 
 * to understand how different aspects of high-level sensory and semantic information are represented and processed in neural populations, underlying cognitive processes such as language and vision;
 * to build computational models for neural encoding and decoding of these cognitive processes in the brain.

To achieve these goals, I develop and apply statistical machine learning methods to analyze large-scale neural data recorded using ECoG, fMRI and M/EEG.
