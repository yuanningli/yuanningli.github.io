## Yuanning Li, Ph.D. [[CV]](/files/Yuanning_Li_CV.pdf)

I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the [Department of Neurological Surgery](http://neurosurgery.ucsf.edu/) at the [University of California, San Francisco](https://www.ucsf.edu/), where I work with [Edward Chang](http://changlab.ucsf.edu). In the Chang Lab, I use human electrophysiology and computational methods to study the neural basis of speech perception. 

Prior to UCSF, I completed my PhD in the joint Program in [Neural Computation](http://compneuro.cmu.edu) & [Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) and the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu), where I was co-advised by [Avniel Ghuman](http://lcnd.pitt.edu) (with [Pitt Neurological Surgery](http://www.neurosurgery.pitt.edu)) and [Max G'Sell](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/people/faculty/mgsell) (with [CMU Statistics](http://www.stat.cmu.edu)). I also collaborated with [Mark Richardson](http://www.brainmodulationlab.org/) and [Julie Fiez](https://www.fiezlab.us/) on various research projects over the course of my PhD. 

Before my PhD, I received Master's degree in [Electrical & Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.cmu.edu) from Carnegie Mellon and Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [School of Advanced Engineering](http://sae.buaa.edu.cn) at [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/). 

My research interests primarily lie in the intersection between computational and cognitive neuroscience. The two main goals of my research are: 
 * to understand how different aspects of high-level sensory information are represented and processed in neural populations, underlying cognitive processes such as speech perception and reading;
 * to build computational models of these perceptual processes in the brain.

To achieve these goals, I develop and apply statistical machine learning methods to analyze large-scale neural data recorded using ECoG, MEG and fMRI.
