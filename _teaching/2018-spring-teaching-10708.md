A core PhD course that covers the theoretical foundations and advanced topics and applications of probabilistic graphical models. The class mainly covers three aspects: The core representation, including Bayesian and Markov networks, and dynamic Bayesian networks; probabilistic inference algorithms, both exact and approximate; and, learning methods for both the parameters and the structure of graphical models.
