collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2014-NatComms
excerpt: 'This paper uses multivariate pattern classification to decode the temporal dynamics of expression-invariant face information processing using intracranial electrodes placed directly in fusiform face area (FFA) in humans. The results show that early FFA activity (50-150 ms) contains category-level face information, while the late FFA activity (200-500 ms) contains expression-invariant inforamtion about individual face identity. These results elucidate the dynamic computational role FFA plays in multiple face processing stages and indicate what information is used in performing these visual analyses.'
