We apply multi-connection pattern analysis (MCPA) to intracranial EEG (iEEG) data recorded simultaneously from two of the core nodes in the face network, the occipital face area (OFA) and the fusiform face area (FFA), to extract the discriminant information about cognitive conditions solely from the shared activity between two neural populations. Our results support the hypothesis that individual-level face information is not only encoded by the population activity within certain brain populations, but also represented through recurrent interactions between multiple distributed populations at the network level. In addition, the temporal dynamics also suggests the involvement of FFA in the face individuation process is a result of temporally synchronized, recurrent interactions between FFA and other nodes in the face-processing network, including the OFA.
