We use MEG and spatiotemporal searchlight to study the dynamics of facial information processing in human braini, including categorical face detection and face individuation. The results elucidate the posterior-to-anterior flow of inforamtion that underpins our ability to individuate and recognize faces. [<ins>[Poster](/files/2014-Biomag-poster.jpg)</ins>]
