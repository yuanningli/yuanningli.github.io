<p>We recorde from 17 subjects with intracranial electrodes implanted in face sensitive pathces of the fusiform to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of expression coding in fusiform. Our results support the hypothesis that the fusiform plays a role in facial expression perception and highlight a functional distinction between processing in posterior fusiform and midfusiform, with each contributing to temporally segregated stages of expression perception.
