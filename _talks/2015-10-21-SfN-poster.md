We propose a novel multivariate statistical method termed Multi-Connection Pattern Analysis (MCPA), which is able to perform single-trial classification based on patterns of functional connectivity between areas. MCPA uses multivariate interactions between neural populations to decode representational content contained in the coupled activity of distributed, interacting neural circuits.
