Cognitive perception does not only depend on the sensory inputs but also depend on the endogenous state that the brain is in when the inputs are presented. In this study, we collect intracranial EEG data from a large cohort of 32 human subjects. Using a block-wise generalized linear model, we evaluate the influence of pre-stimulus endogenous activity on the post-stimulus category tuning and the corresponding perceptual behavior. Our results support the hypothesis that pre-stimulus activity modulates category tuning in the category-selective ventral temporal cortex. Furthermore, the same aspects of the pre-stimulus activity that modulates tuning also predict behavioral performance in the visual recognition task. [<ins>[Slides](/files/2018-VSS-slides.pdf)</ins>]
