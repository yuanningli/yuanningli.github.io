We use direct brain stimulation, pre- and post-surgical behavioral measures, and intracranial electroencephalography to provide support for, and elaborate upon, the "visual word form hypothesis." Our results provide strong support for the visual word form hypothesis and demonstrate lmFGâ€™s role in a dynamic coarse-to-fine shift in word representations.
