In tone languages such as Mandarin Chinese, the pitch trajectory of a syllable distinguishes word meanings. Previous studies have identified cortical regions that are involved in the process of lexical tone perception. However, it remains unclear how the specific acoustic features that underlie tone differences are represented in human non-primary auditory cortex. To understand the auditory cortical representation of lexical tones, we used electrocorticography to record neural activity from Mandarin-speaking participants while they passively listened to natural, continuous Mandarin speech. We found that select neural populations in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) have activity patterns that differentiate lexical tones. Specifically, using representation similarity analysis, we found that the patterns of neural activity in these populations preserve the acoustic differences between lexical tones, while compressing the pitch variance within each tone. Next, using encoding models, we show that these activity patterns can be explained by neural tuning for the speaker-normalized pitch features of relative pitch height and pitch change. Furthermore, we show that these responses are largely language-independent. By having our Mandarin-speaking participants listen to English speech, we could fit encoding models using neural responses to English. These models revealed similar tuning for pitch features as the Mandarin models and were also able to predict responses to Mandarin tones. These results show that neural activity in STG supports categorical perception of lexical tones, and that the representation of lexical tones in STG is based on a language-general, shared encoding of speech related pitch.
